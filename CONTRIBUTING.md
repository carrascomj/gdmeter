# As an user
If you would like to have a feature implemented or you noticed a bug, do not hesitate
to put an [issue in the repository](https://github.com/carrascomj/gdmeter.git).

# As a developer
## Style
* Use [semantic commits](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages).
* 23 incremental Pull Requests are better than 1 commits with 27,000 lines.
* No formatter is on the code right now, just try to keep the style consistent.

## UI improvements, bugfixes or features
Or anything, really.

1. Make sure you have read the [Godot official documentation about Editor Plugins](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/index.html). At least, [_Installing plugins_](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html), [_Making plugins_](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/making_plugins.html) and [_Making main
screen plugins_](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/making_main_screen_plugins.html).
1. Write an [issue](https://github.com/carrascomj/gdmeter.git) (no matter what small your contribution is).
2. Fork the [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/fork-a-repo).
3. Commit a whole bunch of stuff ([this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaPexytJFTI) might be helpful to understand [Git](https://git-scm.com/)).
4. Submit a Pull Request with your feature/bug fix.
5. Get the Pull Request approved.  

The steps of writing the issue before submitting anything are so we all are respectful with each other's time. Maybe another developer can put you in the
right direction before trying to write any code.
